# Scripts

A collection of scripts for personal use.

## readDocker.js

Used to search Docker and dump Dockerfile from automated build repositories. I was using it to learn best practices 
associated with writing Dockerfile for storm. Run the script using 
```shell
node readDocker.js <search criteria>
```
